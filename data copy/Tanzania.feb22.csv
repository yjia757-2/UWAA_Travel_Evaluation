1,ross,appleyard,rwappleyard@comcast.net,Excellent,Pace and variety of stops made this an adventure vacation for Pam and me.  ,Excellent,Excellent,I cannot say enough about Mau's handling of this trip.  I have sent a letter of thanks directly to Leopard Safari.  ,,"Ditto.  Without Pauline on this trip, the difficulties amongst some participants would have blown up to affect the entire group.  Her years of experience were certainly a blessing for us on this trip.",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,,"Would, and have, recommended it whole-heartedly.",,YES,Tour Brochure in the Mail,2017-03-16 17:09:58,public,,
2,Beth,Bursch,hartmann@sonic.net,Excellent,,Excellent,Good,"It was important to Maulid to start out early.  Participants would have been more rested and happier if we had been able to sleep later on the days when an early start was not necessary.  Of course, some of the excursions required us to go early, but others did not, and tempers were a bit short at times due to lack of rest.",Excellent,"Pauline had many problems to deal with on this tour and did a super job, some creative solutions.  I was caught in the middle of one big issue, and I had to work hard on myself to keep from self-pity.  I did spend one day crying, though.",Excellent,,Very Good,,,"UW tours chooses great tour companies, and includes a UW representative to oversee the tour.",YES,Email From UW Alumni Tours,2017-04-11 11:37:07,public,,
3,Susan,White,clinton.white@me.com,Poor,"I am so disappointed and angry about the amount of money we spent on this tour. The tour was a terrible trip and Odyssey's lack of support was unconscionable. Maulid was arrogant the entire tour. Refused to accommodate a simple request for four days,to rotate passengers, so my husband would not be touched on his torso and legs by another passenger. Maulid did not care at all about our comfort or satisfaction on this tour at all. Unbelievable arrogance and stubborn attitude make Maulid an unacceptable guide for any further tours. He never inquired if things were better toward the end of the trip. NEVER. I have by no means encountered such a rude guide, ever. We are world travelers and it took a UW Tanzania Adventure to provide one.",Good,Poor,Fire Maulid.,Excellent,"Pauline tried to accommodate on many levels.I appreciate everything she did very much. Unbelievable Maulid would not listen to her. Maulid has negative issues with women. Pauline and I are included the in bevy of women he treats in a misogynistic manner. I watched his hatred of women bubble over in his treat of native women, hotel clerks and other service providers on our trip. I observe. . .alot.",Very Good,Very Good,Poor,"Rude, uncaring, condescending letters to us. Odyssesy does not care if something goes wrong. This was evident on the evaluations on Yelp I read this month. I do not understand how the University of Washington can support such a tour group that does not listen to the UW tour guide and does not support the travelers who paid over $14,000 for the trip. Unbelievable. Consistent condescending letters were written to us by Bruce Epstein. How can the UW use Odyssey Tours? ","The worst trip we have ever taken with the UW. Actually it is the worst trip we have EVER taken. How can the UW use such a crass, uncaring tour company. ","We have enjoyed our trips with the UW. However something really bad happened to us. The tour company did not support us at all. My husband was touched inappropriately for many days and NOTHING WAS DONE. Why does a man touch another man on the torso and hip continually after being told not to touch the victim (Clint). The perpetuator was told several if not more times to stop touching my husband. He never stopped. Inappropriate touching of this nature implies sexual advances. A simple rotation of passengers would have solved the problem at the beginning of the trip. But no, Maullid refused. Why? We were never told. Why was there no rotation of the vehicles? We were consistently in the back and ate the dirt of the vehicles numbered one and two. Why? We were never told.",YES,Email From UW Alumni Tours,2017-06-01 08:32:13,public,,
